introduction: |-
  This Terraform module will provision a Google Cloud Storage bucket and a service account that has the necessary
  permissions to interact with the bucket. The bucket will be configured with a CORS policy and permit public access via
  the web.

  This module will create the following resources:

  * Google Storage Bucket: The module creates a storage bucket with enabled uniform bucket-level access and CORS
    settings that allow GET and HEAD requests from any origin.
  * Public IAM Policy: It sets a public IAM policy on the bucket, making it readable by "allUsers", allowing anyone on
    the internet to view the bucket.
  * Google Service Account: The module creates a service account that your applications can use to interact with the
    storage bucket.
  * Service Account Key: The module creates a JSON key for the service account and outputs it. Your applications can use
    this key to authenticate as the service account.
  * IAM Policy for the Service Account: It attaches an IAM policy to the bucket giving the service account the "Storage
    Object Admin" role, enabling it to read, write, and list objects in the bucket.

  Caveats
  -------

  While this module is designed to simplify the setup of a GCS bucket and service account, there are a few points that
  users should be aware of:

  * Security of Service Account Keys: The module outputs the private key of the service account in JSON format. This key
    should be stored securely, as anyone with the key can authenticate as the service account. It is marked as sensitive
    to avoid showing it in logs or output, but you are responsible for managing this secret securely.

  * Publicly Readable Bucket: This module creates a bucket that is readable by anyone on the internet. Depending on your
    use case, this might not be what you want. If you need a private bucket, you would need to use a different module.

  * Service Account Permissions: The service account created by this module has the "Storage Object Admin" role on the
    bucket. This allows it to read, write, and list objects in the bucket. Depending on your needs, this might be more
    permissions than you want to grant.

  * Using Project ID: The project ID where you want to create these resources is a required input for this module.
    Please ensure to supply the correct project ID.

  *Remember*, it's good practice to follow the principle of least privilege when setting up IAM policies. Be sure to
  review the created resources and their permissions, and adjust the module as needed to fit your specific use case.

  ```hcl
  # Create a standard label resource. See [null-label](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/#terraform-null-label--)
  module "label" {
    source  = "cloudposse/label/null"
    # We recommend pinning every module to a specific version, though usually you want to use the current one
    # version = "x.x.x"

    namespace = "eg"
    name      = "example"
  }

  module "example" {
    source  = "sr2c/public-storage-bucket/google"
    # We recommend pinning every module to a specific version
    # version = "x.x.x"

    project_id = "example-example-1299830"

    context = module.label.this
