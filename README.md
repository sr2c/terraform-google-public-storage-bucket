## Introduction

This Terraform module will provision a Google Cloud Storage bucket and a service account that has the necessary
permissions to interact with the bucket. The bucket will be configured with a CORS policy and permit public access via
the web.

This module will create the following resources:

* Google Storage Bucket: The module creates a storage bucket with enabled uniform bucket-level access and CORS
  settings that allow GET and HEAD requests from any origin.
* Public IAM Policy: It sets a public IAM policy on the bucket, making it readable by "allUsers", allowing anyone on
  the internet to view the bucket.
* Google Service Account: The module creates a service account that your applications can use to interact with the
  storage bucket.
* Service Account Key: The module creates a JSON key for the service account and outputs it. Your applications can use
  this key to authenticate as the service account.
* IAM Policy for the Service Account: The module attaches IAM policies to the bucket giving the service account the
  "Storage Object Admin" and "Legacy Bucket Reader" roles, enabling it to read, write, list objects in the bucket,
  and read the bucket's metadata.

Caveats
-------

While this module is designed to simplify the setup of a GCS bucket and service account, there are a few points that
users should be aware of:

* Security of Service Account Keys: The module outputs the private key of the service account in JSON format. This key
  should be stored securely, as anyone with the key can authenticate as the service account. It is marked as sensitive
  to avoid showing it in logs or output, but you are responsible for managing this secret securely.

* Publicly Readable Bucket: This module creates a bucket that is readable by anyone on the internet. Depending on your
  use case, this might not be what you want. If you need a private bucket, you would need to use a different module.

* Service Account Permissions: The service account created by this module has the "Storage Object Admin" role on the
  bucket. This allows it to read, write, and list objects in the bucket. Depending on your needs, this might be more
  permissions than you want to grant.

* Using Project ID: The project ID where you want to create these resources is a required input for this module.
  Please ensure to supply the correct project ID.

*Remember*, it's good practice to follow the principle of least privilege when setting up IAM policies. Be sure to
review the created resources and their permissions, and adjust the module as needed to fit your specific use case.



## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** We do not pin modules to versions in our examples because of the
difficulty of keeping the versions in the documentation in sync with the latest released versions.
We highly recommend that in your code you pin the version to the exact version you are
using so that your infrastructure remains stable, and update versions in a
systematic way so that they do not catch you by surprise.

Also, because of a bug in the Terraform registry ([hashicorp/terraform#21417](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21417)),
the registry shows many of our inputs as required when in fact they are optional.
The table below correctly indicates which inputs are required.


```hcl
# Create a standard label resource. See [null-label](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label/#terraform-null-label--)
module "label" {
  source  = "cloudposse/label/null"
  # We recommend pinning every module to a specific version, though usually you want to use the current one
  # version = "x.x.x"

  namespace = "eg"
  name      = "example"
}

module "example" {
  source  = "sr2c/public-storage-bucket/google"
  # We recommend pinning every module to a specific version
  # version = "x.x.x"

  project_id = "example-example-1299830"

  context = module.label.this
}
```

| <a name="input_descriptor_formats"></a> [descriptor\_formats](#input\_descriptor\_formats) | Describe additional descriptors to be output in the `descriptors` output map.<br>Map of maps. Keys are names of descriptors. Values are maps of the form<br>`{<br>   format = string<br>   labels = list(string)<br>}`<br>(Type is `any` so the map values can later be enhanced to provide additional options.)<br>`format` is a Terraform format string to be passed to the `format()` function.<br>`labels` is a list of labels, in order, to pass to `format()` function.<br>Label values will be normalized before being passed to `format()` so they will be<br>identical to how they appear in `id`.<br>Default is `{}` (`descriptors` output will be empty). | `any` | `{}` | no |

### Label Inputs

This Terraform module makes use of the [cloudposse/label/null](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/cloudposse/label/null/latest)
module to generate consistent names and tags for resources.
The label module contains many inputs that are common across all our modules that use the label module, and so
these inputs have been seperated here to make it clearer which inputs are specific to this module.

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| <a name="input_additional_tag_map"></a> [additional\_tag\_map](#input\_additional\_tag\_map) | Additional key-value pairs to add to each map in `tags_as_list_of_maps`. Not added to `tags` or `id`.<br>This is for some rare cases where resources want additional configuration of tags<br>and therefore take a list of maps with tag key, value, and additional configuration. | `map(string)` | `{}` | no |
| <a name="input_attributes"></a> [attributes](#input\_attributes) | ID element. Additional attributes (e.g. `workers` or `cluster`) to add to `id`,<br>in the order they appear in the list. New attributes are appended to the<br>end of the list. The elements of the list are joined by the `delimiter`<br>and treated as a single ID element. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| <a name="input_context"></a> [context](#input\_context) | Single object for setting entire context at once.<br>See description of individual variables for details.<br>Leave string and numeric variables as `null` to use default value.<br>Individual variable settings (non-null) override settings in context object,<br>except for attributes, tags, and additional\_tag\_map, which are merged. | `any` | <pre>{<br>  "additional_tag_map": {},<br>  "attributes": [],<br>  "delimiter": null,<br>  "descriptor_formats": {},<br>  "enabled": true,<br>  "environment": null,<br>  "id_length_limit": null,<br>  "label_key_case": null,<br>  "label_order": [],<br>  "label_value_case": null,<br>  "labels_as_tags": [<br>    "unset"<br>  ],<br>  "name": null,<br>  "namespace": null,<br>  "regex_replace_chars": null,<br>  "stage": null,<br>  "tags": {},<br>  "tenant": null<br>}</pre> | no |
| <a name="input_delimiter"></a> [delimiter](#input\_delimiter) | Delimiter to be used between ID elements.<br>Defaults to `-` (hyphen). Set to `""` to use no delimiter at all. | `string` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_enabled"></a> [enabled](#input\_enabled) | Set to false to prevent the module from creating any resources | `bool` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_environment"></a> [environment](#input\_environment) | ID element. Usually used for region e.g. 'uw2', 'us-west-2', OR role 'prod', 'staging', 'dev', 'UAT' | `string` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_id_length_limit"></a> [id\_length\_limit](#input\_id\_length\_limit) | Limit `id` to this many characters (minimum 6).<br>Set to `0` for unlimited length.<br>Set to `null` for keep the existing setting, which defaults to `0`.<br>Does not affect `id_full`. | `number` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_label_key_case"></a> [label\_key\_case](#input\_label\_key\_case) | Controls the letter case of the `tags` keys (label names) for tags generated by this module.<br>Does not affect keys of tags passed in via the `tags` input.<br>Possible values: `lower`, `title`, `upper`.<br>Default value: `title`. | `string` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_label_order"></a> [label\_order](#input\_label\_order) | The order in which the labels (ID elements) appear in the `id`.<br>Defaults to ["namespace", "environment", "stage", "name", "attributes"].<br>You can omit any of the 6 labels ("tenant" is the 6th), but at least one must be present. | `list(string)` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_label_value_case"></a> [label\_value\_case](#input\_label\_value\_case) | Controls the letter case of ID elements (labels) as included in `id`,<br>set as tag values, and output by this module individually.<br>Does not affect values of tags passed in via the `tags` input.<br>Possible values: `lower`, `title`, `upper` and `none` (no transformation).<br>Set this to `title` and set `delimiter` to `""` to yield Pascal Case IDs.<br>Default value: `lower`. | `string` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_labels_as_tags"></a> [labels\_as\_tags](#input\_labels\_as\_tags) | Set of labels (ID elements) to include as tags in the `tags` output.<br>Default is to include all labels.<br>Tags with empty values will not be included in the `tags` output.<br>Set to `[]` to suppress all generated tags.<br>**Notes:**<br>  The value of the `name` tag, if included, will be the `id`, not the `name`.<br>  Unlike other `null-label` inputs, the initial setting of `labels_as_tags` cannot be<br>  changed in later chained modules. Attempts to change it will be silently ignored. | `set(string)` | <pre>[<br>  "default"<br>]</pre> | no |
| <a name="input_name"></a> [name](#input\_name) | ID element. Usually the component or solution name, e.g. 'app' or 'jenkins'.<br>This is the only ID element not also included as a `tag`.<br>The "name" tag is set to the full `id` string. There is no tag with the value of the `name` input. | `string` | `null` | no |

## Trans Rights

![Trans Rights Are Human Rights][trans_rights]

Trans is an umbrella term to describe people whose gender is not the same as, or does not sit comfortably with, the
sex they were assigned at birth. *Like all people*, they have the right to be treated with dignity and respect and to
have their human rights protected.

Transgender people face significant discrimination and prejudice in many areas of their lives, including employment,
education, housing, and healthcare. They are also at increased risk of violence and hate crimes. These issues
can have a serious impact on the physical and mental well-being of transgender people and can prevent them from fully
participating in society.

Transgender rights are therefore an important part of the broader struggle for human rights. Everyone, regardless of
their gender identity, should be able to live their lives free from discrimination and to enjoy the same rights and
opportunities as everyone else. This includes the right to express their gender identity and to be treated with respect
and dignity.

It is important for society to recognize and respect the rights of transgender people, and to take steps to address the
discrimination and prejudice that they face. This can include supporting policies and laws that protect transgender
people from discrimination and promoting acceptance and understanding of transgender people within the broader
community.

* [Gendered Intelligence](https://genderedintelligence.co.uk/) is a trans-led and trans-involving grassroots organisation
  with a wealth of lived experience, community connections of many kinds, and a depth and breadth of trans community
  knowledge. They offer staff training, consultancy, youth work, mentoring and undertake public engagement activities.

* [TransAid Cymru](https://transaid.cymru/) began life as a local mutual aid group in Cardiff. Tired of the ways that the
  electoral political system had let the trans community down, they decided it was time to do something for themselves.
  Many of the founding members were disabled and unemployed. Familiar with the real, material needs of the trans
  community and how little support there was out there, they founded the mutual aid group in order to provide the services
  the trans community needed.

(or both) of the above groups.
